          Modern hospital management system is an enterprise level software application that connects each and every department. With the software functionalities, every person in the hospital are able to electronically communicate patient clinical and administrative information with one another. It also helps managing the cost of operations by reducing the inventory wastage, managing the resources optimally, billing the patient accurately and delivering the quality of care with right information at right time.
          <br /><br />
          Application will have to be robust and can not afford to have down time as every one will be relying on the data availability 24/7. This requires necessary security and redundancy measures in place. Information unavailability is not an option and will risk patients lives.
          <br /><br />
          A large hospital is equal to a small city with huge demand on type of systems that would be needed to manage their operations. One vendor can not do all, hence the system should be capable of communicating with external third party softwares through standard protocols in order to deliver the functionality required for the department users without the need to duplicate the patient data. Interoperability is not a choice, itâ€™s a mandatory requirement in any HIS. Standards like HL7, FHIR, IHE, DICOM etc help to achieve that.
          <br /><br />
          Hospital Management System is not an off the shelf software which has a set of standard functionality that can be used for a specific purpose for many years. It is more of lifeline for the hospital and it has to meet the objectives of the hospital from the first year of operation. The need and necessity keep changing and growing as they are faced with the challenges from market competition, Social economic changes, regulatory changes. One has to adopt to the patient demand and meet or exceed the expectations.
